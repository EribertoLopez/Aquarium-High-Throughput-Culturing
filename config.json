{"title":"Aquarium High Throughput Culturing","description":"his workflow automates the execution of a high throughput microbial culturing experiment. This assesment will phenotypically characterize the genetically modified culture under the user defined experimental conditions. It will generate a virtual 96 well plate with sorted representations of experimental microbial cultures. The sorting algorithm groups replicates by input item and induction conditions, with the consideration of manual pipetting.","copyright":"University of Washington","version":"0.0.1","authors":[{"name":"Eriberto Lopez","affiliation":"University of Washington"}],"maintainer":{"name":"Eriberto Lopez","email":"elopez3@uw.edu"},"acknowledgements":[{"name":"Cami Cordray","affiliation":"University of Washington"},{"name":"Klavins Lab","affilation":"","affiliation":"UW BIOFAB"}],"github":{"user":"EribertoLopez","repo":"Aquarium-High-Throughput-Culturing","organization":"klavinslab"},"keywords":["Automation","Yeast","E coli","Induction","Flow Cytometry","Plate Reader","DARPA SD2","UW BIOFAB"],"aquadoc_version":"1.0.0","aquarium_version":"\u003c%= Bioturk::Application.config.aquarium_version %\u003e"}
