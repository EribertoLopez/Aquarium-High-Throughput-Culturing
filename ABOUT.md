# Aquarium High Throughput Culturing, version 0.0.1

his workflow automates the execution of a high throughput microbial culturing experiment. This assesment will phenotypically characterize the genetically modified culture under the user defined experimental conditions. It will generate a virtual 96 well plate with sorted representations of experimental microbial cultures. The sorting algorithm groups replicates by input item and induction conditions, with the consideration of manual pipetting.
